# Part 1: Theoretical Understanding 
## 1. Short Answer Questions


### **Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.**

**Algorithmic bias** refers to systematic and repeatable errors in an AI system that result in unfair outcomes, such as privileging one group over another. These biases often arise from biased training data, flawed assumptions, or lack of diverse representation.

**Examples:**

1. **Facial recognition bias:**
   Many facial recognition systems have shown significantly higher error rates for people with darker skin tones compared to lighter-skinned individuals. For instance, some systems misidentified Black women nearly 35% of the time while achieving near-perfect accuracy for white men.

2. **Hiring algorithm bias:**
   An AI hiring tool trained on historical data from a male-dominated tech company may learn to favor resumes with male-associated traits or names, thereby disadvantaging female or non-binary candidates, even when equally qualified.

### **Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?**

* **Transparency** refers to how openly and clearly the workings, design, data sources, and intentions of an AI system are disclosed. It focuses on making the AI development process visible to stakeholders.

* **Explainability** is the ability of an AI system to provide understandable reasons for its decisions or predictions to users, especially non-technical audiences.

**Why both are important:**

* **Transparency** helps build trust, enables regulatory oversight, and fosters accountability by revealing how and why an AI system was built the way it was.
* **Explainability** ensures that end-users and affected parties can understand, question, and challenge AI decisions, which is critical in high-stakes contexts like healthcare, finance, or criminal justice.

Together, they help mitigate misuse, reduce harm, and promote ethical AI deployment.

### **Q3: How does GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) impact AI development in the EU?**

The **GDPR** significantly shapes how AI systems are developed and deployed in the European Union by enforcing data protection rights and promoting responsible data use. Key impacts include:

1. **Data minimization and consent:**
   AI systems must limit data collection to what's necessary and often require explicit consent from individuals, restricting large-scale data scraping or opaque profiling practices.

2. **Right to explanation:**
   Article 22 of the GDPR gives individuals the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, and they can request an explanation — pushing developers to design explainable AI systems.

3. **Accountability and risk assessment:**
   Developers must conduct **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)** when processing personal data in ways that may significantly affect users, particularly in AI-driven profiling.

**Overall**, GDPR encourages AI developers to prioritize privacy, fairness, and user rights by design — adding legal and technical responsibilities to the innovation process.

## 2. Ethical Principles Matching 

* **A) Justice** → *Fair distribution of AI benefits and risks.*

* **B) Non-maleficence** → *Ensuring AI does not harm individuals or society.*

* **C) Autonomy** → *Respecting users’ right to control their data and decisions.*

* **D) Sustainability** → *Designing AI to be environmentally friendly.*

# Part 2: Case Study Analysis 

## Case 1: Biased Hiring Tool

Scenario: Amazon’s AI recruiting tool penalized female candidates.

**Tasks:**

- Identify the source of bias (e.g., training data, model design).

- Propose three fixes to make the tool fairer.

- Suggest metrics to evaluate fairness post-correction.

## Case 2: Facial Recognition in Policing

Scenario: A facial recognition system misidentifies minorities at higher rates.

**Tasks:**

- Discuss ethical risks (e.g., wrongful arrests, privacy violations).

- Recommend policies for responsible deployment.
